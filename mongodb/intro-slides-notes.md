## What is MongoDB

At inception MongoDB was a database that tried to maximize the tradeoff between functionality of relational databases and the pure scalability and performance of key-value stores.

Achieving the desired _scalability_ and _performance_ they got rid of the two things which hurt this the most in relational databases: _joins_ and _transactions_.

To mitigate the loss of _joins_ and _transactions_ they store data in _documents_ to still deliver a high functionality database. Hence, MongoDB is a _Document-store_.

In use MongoDB is a really developer-centric database. The documents stored in MongoDB resembles that of JSON mapping elegantly to the objects of most programming languages around. In addition MongoDB does not require a schema. Also the query language is natively implemented in any programming language it is used.

## Why you should consider MongoDB

We believe this is an important database to you guys because of the simplicity. This is one of many new databases around that really enables developers to be more efficient in their work. Meaning you get to create more amazing stuff in less time.
