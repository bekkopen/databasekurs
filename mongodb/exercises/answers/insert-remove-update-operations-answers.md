# Inserting, removing and updating documents

1. ### Insert a blog post
    Simply insert the entire JSON document. A `_id` field will automatically be generated by the database.

    ```js
    db.posts.insert({
        title: "Foo bar",
        content: "This is just the worst blogpost ever written. How short and pointless could it be really?",
        tags: ['pointless', 'fame', 'instafame', 'fashion'],
        authored: ISODate("2015-01-10T13:37:00Z"),
        author: {
            name: "Blogger pseudonym",
            email: "theblogger@gmail.com",
            twitter: "hipsterhacker"
        }
    });
    ```
2. ### Replace a document

    ```js
    db.posts.update({
        title: "Foo bar"
    }, {
        catastrophic: "failure"
    })
    ```
    _As a sidenote: If you had not specified `title: "Foo bar"` the default behaviour of the update operation would be to alter the **first** document it finds. In this example with only one document in the collection, that document would actually be the correct one._

3. ### Remove a document

    ```js
    db.posts.remove({ catastrophic: "failure" });
    ```
    _`db.posts.remove({})` would remove **all** documents in the posts collection._

4. ### Batch insert
    Bulk inserts work just as single insertions, just pass an array of documents instead of a document.
    ```js
    db.posts.insert([{
        title: "Avatar generator",
        content: "Generate avatars based on a hash. It's pretty hilarious. http://robohash.org",
        tags: ['avatars', 'fake', 'internet'],
        authored: ISODate("2015-01-10T13:37:00Z"),
        author: {
            name: "Mr White",
            email: "mrwhite@gmail.com"
        }
    }, {
        title: "Astronomers Celebrate 300th Anniversary Of Discovering Sky",
        content: "Commemorating one of the most important scientific findings in human history, astronomers around the world Monday celebrated the 300th anniversary of English physicist Edmund Weaver’s discovery of the sky. “We take this knowledge for granted today, but you have to understand that in 1714, people simply had no idea that anything else existed other than the earth’s surface,” said Norio Kaifu, president of the International Astronomical Union, noting that prior to the 18th century it was widely accepted among the scientific community that there was just more ground above them.",

        author: {
            name: "Mr White",
            email: "mrwhite.otheraddress@gmail.com"
        }
    }]);
    ```
